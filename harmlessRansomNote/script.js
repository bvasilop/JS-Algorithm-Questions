/*****
 * Big O Notation
 *  */

// Is a notation used to classify how scalable an algorithm or function is and it allows us to estimate
    // the worst case run-time of an algorithm, or how long it takes the algorithm to complete based on the input size
        // Big O informs us of how much slower an algorithm will run if its input size grows. If the input size
            // gets larger (array of 100 elements instead of array of 50), will the run-time of the function stay
                // the same ? Will the run-time get proportionally larger as the input size increases ? Will the
                    // run-time get exponentially larger or will the run-time change in some other way ?
                        // Big O describes how performant a function or algorithm is.
